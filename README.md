# TrackCovid_final
Problem
One problem with COVID-19 is that infected people don't know when they should go to the hospital. We have an idea how to inform the patients, based on certain health indicators, at which point they should search professional help. It involves the usage of pulse oximeters and biometric data.

Solution
Our idea was to focus on the app dev, as there are already functional bluetooth pulse oximeters in the market which can be used for the data generation. Also, there are apps (like Oximeter, Whoop) which can track metrics like SpO2, Respiratory rate or Pulse. However, they are not using any thresholding on these metrics and won't notify you when your oxygen levels are critical. This is our USP. We want to develop a thresholding algorithm, which would notify you when your health status is critical. If your health stats are in a dangerous zone, you will get a recommendation to contact your local physician, who will decide the further measures to take.

We are also thinking about predictive monitoring, where you will be notified even before you have serious breathing difficulties.
